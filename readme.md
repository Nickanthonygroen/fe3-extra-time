# How I spent my extra time


## Tutorials on youtube.

* [Introduction to D3.js - Bar Graph Tutorial 34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fjmxh-gnBM0&t=142s) - A simple tutorial on how create a bar chart. Explaining the format of CSV is being loaded in to D3. Used this to understand how the chart was being drawn as he codes everything himself. Unfortunately it is coded in D3.V4.

* [Introduction to D3 1:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jvoTV54nXw&t=1996s) A good tutorial as he kinda recaps HTML, CSS and Javascript in the first 30 minutes or so. Then he proceeds to explain a little bit more on the standard functions of d3 like `.domain` and `.range`


## Letting an expert explain stuff to me

I work at a digital agency as a Visual Designer in the time I'm not working for school. But the great thing is that there are a lot of Frontenders that could explain to me what I needed to do and why.

Also on school I have guy, this guy is called Vincent. And he has been my
go to guy when it came down to this: `undefined` || `null` || `{[...]}(1)` with `error`

I basically rubber ducked himðŸ¦ƒ.

## Searching for answers :neckbeard:

Here is the list of stuff I had to google since I didn't understand how to change them at first hand.

* [Tick Format](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/9764126) To change the format of the ticks.

* [Time Parse](https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format) This was a big one. Cleaning the data for the KNMI weather graph was by far one of the biggest issues to solve in my life ðŸ¤”. For the longest time my console was like: `undefined` || `null` || `{[...]}(1)` with `error`

* [D3 Nest](http://bl.ocks.org/phoebebright/raw/3176159/) The next big thing was nesting the dirty data so it could be used for the clean assignment and of course assessment 2.

* [For...in](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in) For the last assessment I needed to check the keys and push them into an empty array. I spent a quite bit on the site to understand what was going on.

* [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) I don't know if you noticed but my readme's have improved quite a bit since I used this cheat sheet like everytime a readme was required. Which was also everytime you had to upload an assignment.


## Add styling to my charts

Okay so maybe it wasn't the best, but I tried to style every chart differently and make use some pseudo classes with the interaction. I tried to match the last assessment to my assessment for Datavisualisation.

## Research for Data

One of the biggest flaws of my first examination of Research for Data was that my datasets weren't visualised enough. Using [RawGraphs](http://rawgraphs.io/) to visualize data sets quickly meant that you had to upload a proper data format. I realized that JSON worked better with the datasets I had so I manually changed some of the datasets for my re-examination.
